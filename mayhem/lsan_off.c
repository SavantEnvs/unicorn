/* Fleet policy (SPEC.md 6.1): disable LeakSanitizer preventively at BUILD time. ASan
   use-after-free/overflow and UBSan stay fully on and halting -- only leak detection is affected.

   unicorn's harnesses drive uc_open()/uc_emu_start() over attacker-controlled guest code. A guest
   that faults or runs out of its instruction budget leaves per-CPU translation-block and memory-map
   state owned by the emulator, and the harness deliberately does not tear the engine down on every
   iteration, so LSan reports on inputs that are not the defect being hunted.

   A runtime ASan default-options override -- whether compiled in or passed via ASAN_OPTIONS -- is
   forbidden, because Mayhem alone owns the runtime ASAN/LibFuzzer option set, so this is done via
   the sanctioned build-time hook instead. SPEC.md 6.2 item 15 bans the override symbol NAMES
   anywhere under mayhem/, comments included, so the forbidden construct is described in prose here
   rather than named. __lsan_is_turned_off is the sanctioned hook and is NOT the banned construct. */
